# Convolutional Neural Network Deep Learning Project

This is a project where I built the LE-NET 5 Convolutional Neural Network Deep Learning Model to classify the MNIST Dataset. The project has two parts. There will be both and implementation using the Tensorflow API aswell as by scratch. 

## Project Overview

### Objective

The main goal of this project is to train a LE-NET 5 Convolutional Neural Network to classify the MNIST Dataset. A normal Neural Network will be utilised to compare against LE-NET 5.

### Features

- **data_ingestion_tools:** Toolkit used for data ingestion.
- **Model Implementation:** The LE-NET 5 Convolutional neural network model is implemented using Numpy and also using Tensorflow.
- **Visualization:** The results and performance of all models are visualized using Matplotlib.

## Project Structure

- **`data_ingestion_tools.py`:** Python Class to assist with Data Ingestion.
- **`cnnbsMNISTImplementation.ipynb`:** CNN vs NN by scratch.
- **`tensorflowMNISTImplementation.ipynb`:** CNN vs NN Using Tensorflow.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GIGACHADhoon/ConvNets.git
    cd ConvNets
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install gzip
    pip install idx2numpy
    ```
